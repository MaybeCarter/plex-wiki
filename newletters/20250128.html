      <h1>Hyperdrive Newsletter</h1>
      <h2>Recent Updates to Your Favorite Plex Server</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Hi all!</p>
      <p>I've been hard at work over the past several weeks improving virtually every aspect of my Plex server to provide a better, faster, and more enjoyable streaming experience. I'm thrilled to share some of the highlights with you! Here's what's new:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Hardware Upgrades</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>New server:</b> Hyperdrive has been successfully migrated from a 2014 Intel i5 Mac mini to a brand-new <b>M4 Mac mini</b>. You can expect even smoother playback and much faster transcoding.</li>
                <li><b>Expandable storage:</b> I've added a <b>four-bay HDD enclosure</b>, capable of housing up to 96TB of data (for the curious, there's currently about 18TB of data). This expandable solution ensures there’s plenty of room for all the movies and shows you love — and then some!</li>
                <li><b>Network improvements:</b> Optimized connections enable <i>siginificantly</i> faster downloads and seamless streaming.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <li><b>Content Additions & Improvements</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Higher-Quality Releases:</b> I have spent considerable time creating and fine-tuning <b>Custom Formats</b> to prioritize the highest-quality releases available. This ensures that:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Movies and shows are sourced from the best release groups.</li>
                        <li>Preferences for resolution, audio quality, and other factors are automatically applied.</li>
                        <li>You get a consistently excellent viewing experience.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>All movies and TV shows have been upgraded to the highest quality releases available (within my prexisiting parameters), and both exising and new media will continue to be upgraded as higher quality media becomes available. While it may seem like a small change, this is actually the upgrade that I'm most excited about and will likely be the biggest improvement you see in the available content.</p>
                <li><b>New Movies & Shows:</b> There are now over 1,300 movies and nearly 8,000 episodes of TV available, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nearly every Oscar-nominated film from 2024, and every Oscar winner from 2019 and later.</li>
                        <li>All of IMDb's Top 250 movies.</li>
                        <li>Most items on IMDb's Popular lists, such as <i>Moana 2</i>, <i>Severance</i>, <i>Nosferatu</i>, <i>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</i>, and many, many others.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
        <li><b>Ongoing Efforts</b></li>
            <p>I'm always working behind the scenes to make the experience as polished, intuitive, and enjoyable as possible. This includes choosing <b>custom posters</b> for every movie, TV show, and season, providing <b>subtitles</b> for as much content as possible, and creating <b>automated collections and playlists</b> to make browsing my ever-growing library a little less intimidating.</p>
      </ol>
      <p>With these upgrades, Hyperdrive should be faster and more stable, but if you run into any issues, check <a href="https://github.com/MaybeCarter/plex-wiki/">the wiki</a> or reach out to me directly. I’m always happy to hear your feedback and suggestions.
      <p>Thank you for being a part of this community and for making the server such a joy to maintain. Enjoy exploring the new and improved library, and happy streaming!</p>
      <p>— Carter</p>
