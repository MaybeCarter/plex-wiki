# Welcome	
If you're reading this, it's because I've shared my Plex library with you. You might have some questions. *I recommend reading through this all first before going through the setup.*

## What is Plex?
Plex is a media server that I run on my own computer. Think of it as a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu, but all the content is stored on a computer in my living room. You have access to over 900 movies and over 4,500 TV episodes.

## Is it safe?
Yes. Plex only serves media (in the case of my server, only video). There's nothing that could harm you. My family, a few select friends, and I have been using Plex for more than a year now without any issues. I'm assuming all of the risk. 

## Why use this instead of other streaming services?
My favorite thing about Plex is that everything I'm watching is in one place. It cannot be overstated how convenient it is to never have to look up what streaming service, if any, a particular movie or show is on. You also never have to worry about content leaving Plex due to complicated licensing battles like you to with Big Streaming. And while you get to have access to my Plex server, it's really a personal hobby project that started because I wanted more control than the streaming services I was using. 

## I'm in
Sweet. If I don't have it already, send me your email address so I can invite you.

# Getting Started
> This assumes that you're on a computer. Steps may be different on mobile.

Check your email. You should have received an email from noreply@plex.tv with the subject "You've been invited to share some media in Plex."
*Don't worry, you're not sharing media with me, and the only way that could happen is if you download and setup a server. You'd know.*

It will look like this: 

![share_email.png](/images/share_email.png)

Click `I accept the invitation`.

You'll be greeted with the "Account Sign in" page. If you already have a Plex account, just sign in. Otherwise, select one of the "Continue with..." options to use a single sign on, or  click the dark grey `sign up with email` text under the `Sign In` button. 

> Make sure the method you sign in with uses the same email address that I sent the invite to. If you used `Continue with Apple` and chose to hide your email, I need the obfuscated email address (it'll be something like seniors_reprint_00@icloud.com or spender_pet.0o@icloud.com), not your actual iCloud email address.

Once you've signed in, you'll be on the "Manage Library Access" page. You should see that you have access to two libraries shared by me (Movies and TV Shows). 

![library_access.png](/images/library_access.png)

Before we go to the Home page, let's make some quick settings adjustments:
> These changes will only apply to Plex Web. Please make the same adjustments on every platform on which you plan to use Plex. 

- Click  `General` under "Plex Web" on the left-hand sidebar. Feel free to enable `Play Theme Music`, I think it's neat.
- Next, click `Quality` in the side bar, here are my recommended settings: 

    ![recommended_settings.png](/images/settings.png)

    > You may find that you want to enable `Automatically adjust quality (Beta)` if you have issues streaming.

- Finally, click `Player` in the sidebar, `Show Advanced`, and disable `Normalize Multi-channel Audio`.

Now, click on the home button in the top left corner, and you'll see the "Plex Web Setup" page, with a list of pinned sources. Uncheck everything except `Movies` and `TV Shows`. It's up to you if you want to keep `Watchlist` pinned or not. The other items are not shared by me, and will only make your Plex experience more confusing. 

![unpin.png](/images/unpin_setup.png)

Once you've unchecked `Playlists`, `Live TV`, `Movies & Shows`, `Discover`, and `Music`, (and `Watchlist`, if you want) click `Finish Setup`. 

You should be greeted by the Home page:

# Next Steps
Great! You made a Plex account and got all set up for an optimal streaming experience. 

## Download Apps
Plex has apps for pretty much every device you'd ever want to stream media on. Unfortunately, on mobile devices you do have to make one-time in-app purchase of $5 to be able to stream media. If you're on desktop, download the  app [here for Mac](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=macos#plex-app) or [here for Windows](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=win#plex-app).

Plex is also available on all major set-top boxes and smart TVs. 
> If you have both a smart TV and set-top box, I _beg_ you to use the Plex app on the set-top box instead of the smart TV app. Actually, you should use _every_ app on the set-top box instead of the smart TV alternative.

## Can't Find What You Want? 
If there's something you want to watch that I don't yet have on my Plex server, you can request it yourself. Requested content is usually available within a few minutes. Let's get set up with Overseerr, my automated request management platform:

1. Go to [overseerr.cartersanderson.com](https://overseerr.cartersanderson.com). 
    > Steps 2 and 3 apply to mobile only, specifically iOS. Skip these steps on desktop. 
2. Select the share icon (a square with an arrow coming out of it) and tap `Add to Home Screen`.
3. Open the Overseerr app icon from your Home Screen. 
4. Sign into your Plex account.
5. When prompted, I would recommend allowing notifications so that you know when requested content is available on Plex. 
    > Getting the "Allow Notifications from Overseer?" prompt to show up on iOS can be a little tricky. The best method I've found is by going to `Settings`, `Notifications`, `Web Push`, and making sure all the options are enabled. Then tap `Save Changes` and go back to the Home page. 

Now, anytime you want to watch anything that isn't yet on my server, just open up Overseerr, search for the content you want and select `Request`. It should be available in just a few minutes. 

## Notice an issue with content? 
If you're watching something and you notice an issue with the content, let me know! (Not directly - it's not you, but I'll probably forget about it.) You have two options:

1. **From  Plex:**  On the page for the episode or movie that has an issue, click the three dot button and select `Report Issue...` from the dropdown.

    ![issue_plex_1](/images/issue_plex_1.png)

2. **From Overseer:** Find the item on [Overseerr](https://overseerr.cartersanderson.com) and click on the yellow `Report an Issue` button on the right side.

    ![issue_overseerr_1.png](/images/issue_overseerr_1.png)

    >  The more detail you can provide in your Issue Report, the better! Include timestamps, if the issue is with video, audio, subtitles, or something else, and any troubleshooting you've already completed.

## Having a more serious problem? 
My Plex server is not running on the most impressive hardware, so issues pop up from time to time. If you run into an issue that completely prevents you from streaming (such as "Hyperdrive is currently unavailable" or nonstop buffering), shoot me a text and I'll do my best to fix the issue.

## Other fun stuff
I take pride in hosting an aesthetically pleasing and well-organized server. One of my favorite parts is the `Collections` tab within the `Movies` library. Not only are movies organized by franchise (like *Shrek* or *The Godfather*), there are also collections for studios, directors, Oscars, and IMDb Top 250 and Popular lists. If you don't know what you want to watch, the Collections tab is a great place to start. 

![collections.png](images/collections.png)

There is also a shuffle button! You can shuffle TV shows, collections, or if you're feeling brave, you can shuffle the entire library. 

## FAQs
- Thanks for letting me access your Plex server! Can I pay you for your generosity? 
    > **No.** Please don't. Selling access to a Plex server is strictly against Plex's terms of service and could get my whole server shut down. Don't be the person to ruin it for everyone. If you want to support Plex, you can [purchase Plex Pass](https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/), which will get you features like Skip Intro/Credits and extra content like cast interviews and deleted scenes. 
- I requested a movie a while ago, but it's still not available on Plex. Why not? 
    > For me to host it on Plex, a movie has to be available outside of theaters. If it's not available on streaming, video on-demand, or DVD/Bluray, it won't be available on Plex. 
- Why don't you have any 4K or Remux content on your server? 
    > Even if I had infinite storage space (which I don't), 4K and Remux files are such high bitrate that they're more hassle than they are worth, for both my server and your client. 
- What resolution is the content on your server?
    > For movies, the files are the highest quality available, up to 1080p. Since TV shows are so much longer than movies, I keep most of them at 720p to conserve storage space. 
- Why are there more than 250 movies in the IMDb Top 250 Collection? 
    > I have multiple versions of the Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings trilogies, and each edition is counted as a separate movie within the collection.    
- What hardware is your Plex server running on? 
    > My Plex server is running on a late 2014 Mac mini with a 2.6 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 and 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 memory. 
- I keep seeing the word "Hyperdrive." What's that? 
    > I love Star Wars, and I love a naming convention. All of my Apple products are named after people, places, and things from the Star Wars universe. Hyperdrive is the name of the server that Plex is running on, so you might see that name from time to time.
