# Welcome	
If you're reading this, it's because I've shared my Plex library with you. You likely have some questions. *I recommend reading through this all first before going through the setup.*

## What is Plex?

Plex is a media server that I run on my own computer. Think of it as a streaming service like Netflix or Hulu, but all the content is stored on a computer in my living room. You have access to over 700 movies and over 3,000 TV episodes.

## Is it safe?

Yes. I've already checked all the files and ensured they're safe, and there's nothing that could happen to you. My family, a few select friends, and I have been using Plex for close to a decade now without any issues or harm. I'm assuming all of the risk. 

## Why use this versus streaming services?

Everything in one spot, for one. Also, I've found streaming services kind of suck depending on device your streaming on. Plex is consistent. Also, Plex has a shuffle button. Try it out, especially on shows you've seen more than once. It's a nice way to say "I want to watch an episode of this, but I don't care which one, or if they're in order". I use it with Family Guy and American Dad to fall asleep, and with Psych when I work from home. 

## I'm in

Sweet. If you haven't yet given me your email address, please do so now so I can invite you. 

# Getting Started
> This assumes that you're on a computer. Steps may be different on mobile.

Check your email. You should have received an email from noreply@plex.tv with the subject "You've been invited to share some media in Plex."
*Don't worry, you're not sharing media with me, and the only way that could happen is if you download and setup a server. You'd know.*

It will look like this: 

![share_email.png](/images/share_email.png)

Click `I accept the invitation`.

You'll be greeted with the Account Sign in page. If you already have a Plex account, just sign in. Otherwise, you can select one of the "Continue with..." options to use a single sign on, or you can press the dark grey `sign up with email` text under the `Sign In` button. 

> Make sure whatever method you use uses the same email that I sent the invite to. If you used `Continue with Apple` and chose to hide your email, I need the obfuscated email address (it'll be something like seniors_reprint_00@icloud.com or spender_pet.0o@icloud.com), not your actual iCloud email address.

Once you've signed in, you'll be on the "Manage Library Access" page. You should see that you have access to two libraries shared by me (Movies and TV shows).

Before we go to the Home page, let's make some settings adjustments:
> These changes will only apply to Plex Web. Please make the same adjustments on each platform you intend to use Plex. 
- Click  `General` under "Plex Web" on the left-hand sidebar. Feel free to enable "Play Theme Music", I think it's neat.
- Next, click `Quality` in the side bar, here are my recommended settings: 

    ![recommended_settings.png](/images/settings.png)

    > You may find that you want to enable `Automatically adjust quality (Beta)` if you have issues streaming.

- Finally, click `Player` in the sidebar, `Show Advanced`, and disable `Normalize Multi-channel Audio`.

Now, click on the home button in the top left corner, and you'll see the "Plex Web Setup" page, with a list of pinned sources. Uncheck everything except `Movies` and `TV Shows`. It's up to you if you want to keep `Watchlist` pinned or not. The other items are not shared by me, and will only make your Plex experience more confusing. 

![unpin.png](/images/unpin_setup.png)

Once you've unchecked `Playlists`, `Live TV`, `Movies & Shows`, `Discover`, and `Music`, (and `Watchlist`, if you want) click `Finish Setup`. 

You should be greeted by the Home screen:

# Next Steps
Great! You made a Plex account and got all set up for an optimal streaming experience. 

## Download Apps
Plex has apps for pretty much every device you'd ever want to stream media on. Unfortunately, on mobile devices you do have to make one-time in-app purchase of $5 to be able to stream media. If you're on desktop, download the desktop app [here for Mac](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=macos#plex-app) or [here for Windows](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=win#plex-app).

Plex is also available on all major set-top boxes and smart TVs. 
> If you have both a smart TV and set-top box, I _beg_ you to use the Plex app on the set-top box instead of the smart TV app. Actually, you should use _every_ app on the set-top box instead of the smart TV alternative.

## Can't Find What You Want? 
If there's something you want to watch that I don't yet have on my Plex server, you can request it yourself. Requested content is usually available within a few minutes. Let's get set up with Overseerr, my automated request management platform:

1. Go to [overseerr.cartersanderson.com](https://overseerr.cartersanderson.com). 
    > Steps 2 and 3 apply to mobile only, specifically iOS. Skip these steps on desktop. 
2. Select the share icon (a square with an arrow coming out of it) and tap "Add to Home Screen." 
3. Open the Overseerr app icon from your Home Screen. 
4. Sign into your Plex account.
5. When prompted, I would recommend allowing notifications so that you know when requested content is available on Plex. 
    > Getting the "Allow Notifications from Overseer?" prompt to show up on iOS can be a little tricky. The best method I've found is by going to `Settings`, `Notifications`, `Web Push`, and making sure all the options are enabled. Then tap `Save Changes` and go back to the Home page. 

Now, anytime you want to watch anything that isn't yet on my server, just open up Overseerr, search for the content you want and tap "Request." It should be available in just a few minutes. 

## Notice an issue with content? 
If you're watching something and you notice an issue with the content, let me know! (Not directly, it's not you, but I'll probably forget about it.) You have two options:

1. **From  Plex:**  On the page for the episode or Movie that has an issue, click the three dot button and select `Report Issue...` from the dropdown.

    ![issue_plex_1](/images/issue_plex_1.png)

2. **From Overseer:** Find the item on [Overseerr](https://overseerr.cartersanderson.com) and click on the yellow `Report an Issue` button on the right side.

    ![issue_overseerr_1.png](/images/issue_overseerr_1.png)

    >  The more detail you can provide, the better! Include timestamps, if the issue is with video, audio, subtitles, or something else, and any troubleshooting you've already completed.

## Having a more serious problem? 
My Plex server is not running on the most impressive hardware, so issues pop up from time to time. If you run into an issue that completely prevents you from streaming (such as "Hyperdrive is currently unavailable" or nonstop buffering), shoot me a text and I'll do my best to fix the issue.

## FAQs
- I requested a movie a while ago, but it's still not on Plex. Why not? 
    > For me to host it on Plex, a movie has to be available outside of theaters. If it's not available on streaming, video on-demand, or DVD/Bluray, it won't be available on Plex.    
- What hardware is your Plex server running on? 
    > My Plex server is running on a late 2014 Mac mini with a 2.6 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 and 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 memory. 
- I keep seeing the word "Hyperdrive." What's that? 
    > I love Star Wars, and I love a naming convention. All of my Apple products are named after people, places, and things from the Star Wars universe. Hyperdrive is the name of the server that Plex is running on, so you might see that name from time to time. 
- Thanks for letting me access your Plex server! Can I pay you for your generosity? 
    > **No.** Please don't. Selling access to a Plex server is strictly against Plex's terms of service and could get my whole server shut down. Don't be the person to ruin it for everyone.
